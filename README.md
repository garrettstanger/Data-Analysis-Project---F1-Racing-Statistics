# Overview

This is my project on using Python and Pandas to analyze an F1 Racing statistics dataset. All of the code is in the .ipynb file.

This dataset includes statistics such as races won, lap times, DOB, pit stop times, etc. I got this dataset from kaggle.com, specifically [F1 Championship Racing Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020)

I created this project to practice using pandas and python to be able to not only read through csv data but also work on manipulating the data I found and display
it in more helpful ways.

# Data Analysis Results

Which driver has had the most wins since 1950?
Kimi Räikkönen, a Finnish driver, with about 350 wins. The next closest is Fernando Alonso with about 340 wins. 
What were Lewis Hamilton's (popular modern driver) best race times?
Very consistent driver, most of his best lap times are below one minute 7 seconds.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my editor and Youtube and Zoom as my video tools.

I used the Python language with the Pandas and matplotlib libraries. I also used a jupyter notebooks extension so I could create notebooks inside
my editor.

# Future Work

* I want to be able to find more ways to display more complex sets of data like how to differentiate the different races based on their times.
* I dabbled a little bit into how to read all of the files at once so I can just reference them once. I want to figure that out sometime.
* Like with all of my projects, I need to work on making them prettier so they are easier to read and follow.
